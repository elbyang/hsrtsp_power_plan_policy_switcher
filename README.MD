Super basic C Console Win32 App to switch between a specific power plan setting that seems to affect Game performance when using PBO on AMD X3D CPU's.

ALT+Z = Switches between the "All" / "Prefer Performant" / "Performant Only" options

Alt+X = cycles through all options (including the "Efficient" ones and "Automatic")

To build just make sure you either have cl in your PATH (or just use the developer command prompt from visual studio since that already has it in its env variables), or gcc, then run build.bat

Of course if you prefer just download the exe I compiled from the Release tab, but that's up to you.
